The Data folder contains all of my datasets, processed and raw, along with the scripts I used for creating the processed sets.

TF.py and TF10.py were python scripts that I used for testing different architecutres and code.

In the networks folder I have several appoaches I took running my experiments. I have hard coded versions of all the various experiments as well as two generalized versions for 5 and 10 input years named full5.py and full10.py. For this I used runall.py to supply arguments to allow for easier and more efficient running of experiments.

Any questions in regards to my code or methodology can be directed to chrisperlette@gmail.com
